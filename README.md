# DMET

## Overview
DMET (Density Matrix Embedding Theory) is a quantum embedding method for solving strongly correlated electron systems. This repository provides an implementation of DMET for the Hubbard model.

## Installation

You can install directly from GitHub:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/miles0428/DMET.git
```

Or clone the repository manually:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/miles0428/DMET.git
cd DMET
pip install .
```

## Getting Started

To get started, please refer to the Jupyter notebooks in the `examples/` directory:
- `ProblemFormulation.ipynb`: Introduction to problem formulation and Hamiltonian construction.
- `ProblemSolver.ipynb`: How to solve quantum many-body problems and use solvers in DMET.
- `DMET_Hubbard.ipynb`: Full DMET workflow for the Hubbard model.

These notebooks provide step-by-step instructions and code examples for using DMET and its modules.
