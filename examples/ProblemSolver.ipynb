    "# Problem Solver Introduction\n",

    "## Purpose of ProblemSolver in DMET\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ProblemSolver` module is used in DMET (Density Matrix Embedding Theory) to solve quantum many-body problems for embedded Hamiltonians. Its main functions include:\n",
    "- Calculating ground state energies for fragment or impurity Hamiltonians.\n",
    "- Obtaining one-body and two-body reduced density matrices (1-RDM and 2-RDM) for self-consistency and correlation analysis.\n",
    "- Supporting both classical and quantum algorithms for eigenvalue problems, making it suitable for different system sizes and computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In DMET workflows, ProblemSolver is a core component for accurate quantum simulations and embedding procedures."
